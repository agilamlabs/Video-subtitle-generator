So, yeah this is a video subtitle generator, you can upload up to 10 GB video file, it

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:17,879
extracts audio first and then generates subtitles and it embeds that subtitle into the

3
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:22,039
video and it at last it gives you two format.

4
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:29,280
One you can download just subtitles and you can download the video with the subtitle

5
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:36,280
and you after that there is another choice that you can play the video, the embedded video

6
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:45,240
that means the subtitles included video into the player itself like it shows you.

00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:45,719
